# MetaUniversity_CapstoneProject

## Project Description
- Allows users to customize and create lists of activities, grouped based on general categories. The user can also randomly generate an activity 
from the list based on a time parameter. The website will automatically add the activity to the user's calendar on the desired day and/or time. 

## Core Features
- Search bar that filters recipes based on user input
- User can view automatically generated recipe lists based on set categories (Ex: time, type of meal)
- Users can view view recipe details such as instructions, ingredients, and total time
- User Login via google
  - Used authentication tool, OAuth2, with google api to allow users to log in with their google accounts
- Logged in users canâ€¦
  - create new lists
  - add recipes to their own list
  - Add either a chosen recipe or a randomly generated recipe (from specified category) to their google calendar given a start time
  - Determines the total time it takes to make a given recipe and updates the end time of the google calendar event automatically

## Stretch features
- Optimized search bar so that api calls are only made after the user stops typing for a certain amount of time
  - prevents the multiple unnecessary api calls from being made every time the user changes the search input
- Created allergen tags for all recipes based on common ingredeints that trigger the allergy
